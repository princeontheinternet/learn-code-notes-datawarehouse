## Traditional Data Teams

* Data engineers are responsible for maintaining data infrastructure and the ETL process for creating tables and views.

* Data analysts focus on querying tables and views to drive business intelligence for stakeholders.

## ETL and ELT

* ETL (extract transform load) is the process of creating new database objects by extracting data from multiple data sources, transforming it on a local or third party machine, and loading the transformed data into a data warehouse.

* ELT (extract load transform) is a more recent process of creating new database objects by first extracting and loading raw data into a data warehouse and then transforming that data directly in the warehouse.

* The new ELT process is made possible by the introduction of cloud-based data warehouse technologies.

## Analytics Engineering

* Analytics engineers focus on the transformation of raw data into transformed data that is ready for analysis. This new role in the data team changes the nature of data engineers and data analysts.

* Data engineers can focus on larger data architecture and the EL in ELT.

* Data analysts can focus on insight and dashboard work using the transformed data.

* Note: At a small company, a data team of one may own all three of these roles and responsibilities. As your team grows, the lines between these roles will remain blurry.

## dbt

* data build tool (dbt) empowers data teams to leverage software engineering principles for transforming data.

* The focus of this course is to build your analytics engineering mindset and dbt skills to give you more leverage in your work.
