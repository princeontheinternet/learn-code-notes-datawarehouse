# DataWarehouse

* A Data Warehouse is any system that collates data from a wide range of sources within an organization.
<br/><br/>
* It is a **relational database** that is designed for query and analysis.
<br/><br/>  
* Data warehouses are used as centralized data repositories for analytical and reporting purposes.
<br/><br/>
* Definition according to **Bill Inmon** (A computer Scientist known as the _**Father of Data Warehouse**_):
  
  * ### Data warehouse is a -

    * **Subject Oriented:** 
      
      * Data that gives information about particular subject instead of about a company's on going operation.
      * Data is stored by subjects like Sales, Purchase, Inventory, etc. 
      * These are also known as Data Marts.
        <br/><br/>      
    * **Integrated:** 
      
      * Data comes from various sources and has to be integrated in one standard form into DWH.
      * Steps to integrate-
        * _Remove inconsistencies:_ Like a column from one source has Gender as male/female and from another source as M/F
            1. Naming Convention
            2. Codes
            3. Data Attributes
            4. Measurements  
               The above 4 things needs to be standardized.
        * _Transformation_
        * _Integration of source data._
<br/><br/>      
    * **Non-volatile:**
      
        * Non-volatile means that once the data has entered into the warehouse, it cannot be removed or changed(delete or update) 
          because of the purpose of the warehouse is to analyze the data.
<br/><br/>          
    * **Time variant:**
        
        * Time variant means that the data warehouse stores all historical data that can be used for analysis.
